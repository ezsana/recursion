What is Recursion? (geeksforgeeks)
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called
recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH),
Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

What is base condition in recursion?
In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution
of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.

    int factorial(int n)
    {
        if (n <= 1)  // base case
            return 1;
        else
            return n*factorial(n-1);
    }

In the above example, base case for n < = 1 is defined and larger value of number can be solved
by converting to smaller one till base case is reached.

Stack:
          |   return 1;  - base case = 1;     => factorial(1) = 1;
          |   return 2*factorial(1); = 2 * 1!; => factorial(2) = 2;
          |   return 3*factorial(2); = 3 * 2!; => factorial(3) = 6;
          |   return 4*factorial(3); = 4 * 3!; => factorial(4) = 24;
         \ /  return 5*factorial(4); = 5 * 4!; => factorial(5) = 120;
